# RiBOEngine

It's a very simple rigidbody simulation based on Baraff & Witkin papers.

For 3D object display, the old version of OpenGL is used **freeglut** and **glew** libs.

Lot of work to be done in order to configure a clear interface: no GUI implemented, so everything must be set via code right now.

## Dependencies

- Visual Studio 2017
- [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) is a free-software/open-source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
